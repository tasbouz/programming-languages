    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. It is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library. Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages used for web development, software development,\n",
    "mathematics, system scripting, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc) and has a simple syntax similar to the English language. It has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "It runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick. It can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this notebook."

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to install python is through a python version management. In this notebook I will use `pyenv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pyenv\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pyenv`, previously known as `Pythonbrew`, is a python version management tool that lets you install multiple Python versions, change the global Python version, set project (directory) specific Python versions, and create and manage virtual python environments (virtualenvs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv can be simply installed via homebrew:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "brew install pyenv\n",
    "brew install pyenv-virtualenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When installed on a mac, in order for `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv` to work correctly one needs to include them in `PATH`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv”' >> $HOME/.zshrc\n",
    "echo 'export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> $HOME/.zshrc\n",
    "echo 'eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"' >> $HOME/.zshrc\n",
    "echo 'eval \"$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)\"' >> $HOME/.zshrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once install one can see all available versions able to be installed with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pyenv install --list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and install one or multiple versions with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pyenv install <version>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to see all versions installed via pyenv:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pyenv versions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a python version is installed it can be set as the global (default) version by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pyenv global <version>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or locally to a specific project (directory), which overrides the global version when in directory, by `cd` to the directory of the project and:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pyenv local <version>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A version is set in a hidden `.python-version` file within the directory. One can see the current version along with information on how it was set by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pyenv version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or see the path of the python version used by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pyenv which python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, one can uninstall a version simply by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pyenv uninstall <version>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pyenv-Virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Through `pyenv-virtualenv` one can install and manage different python environments for different python versions. In order to create a virtual environment using a specific (already installed via `pyenv`) Python version:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pyenv virtualenv <version> <virtualenv>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to `pyenv`, in oder to see all available enviroments installed via `pyenv-virtualenv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pyenv virtualenvs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a virtualenv is installed it can be set as the global virtualenv by:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one. However you have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "Comments start with a `#`, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment. Comments can be used to explain Python code, to make the code more readable, and to prevent execution when testing code. Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments. To add a multiline comment you could insert a `#` for each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "Variables are containers for storing data values. Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set. Variable names are case-sensitive.\n",
    "A variable can have a short name (like `x` and `y`) or a more descriptive name (`age`, `carname`, `total_volume`). However there are some specific rules for Python variables:\n",
    "* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\n",
    "* A variable name cannot start with a number\n",
    "* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\n",
    "* Variable names are case-sensitive (`age`, `Age` and `AGE` are three different variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read. There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:\n",
    "* **Camel Case**, where each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "myVariableName = \"John\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pascal Case**, where each word starts with a capital letter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MyVariableName = \"John\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Snake Case**, where each word is separated by an underscore character:\n",
    "\n",

A data type tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. A data type constrains the possible values that an expression, such as a variable or a function, might take. This data type defines the operations that can be done on the data, the meaning of the data, and the way values of that type can be stored. Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:\n",

    "## Object Oriented Programing (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm (way to classify programming languages based on their features) based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. In this brand of OOP, there is usually a special name such as `this` or `self` used to refer to the current object. In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a  multi-paradigm programming language and it supports object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages that support object-oriented programming (OOP) typically use inheritance for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either classes or prototypes. Those that use classes support two main concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Classes**: The definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functions\n",
    "* **Objects**: Instances of classes (in a computer system, any time a new context is created based on some model, it is said that the model has been instantiated). Each object is said to be an instance of a particular class (for example, an object with its name field set to \"Mary\" might be an instance of class Employee). \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in object-oriented programming are known as methods. Variables are also known as attributes. This leads to the following terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class Variables**: data that belongs to the class as a whole; there is only one copy of each one.\n",
    "* **Instance Variables** or **Attributes**: data that belongs to individual objects; every object has its own copy of each one.\n",
    "* **Class Methods**: belong to the class as a whole and have access to only class variables and inputs from the procedure call\n",
    "* **Instance Methods**: belong to individual objects, and have access to instance variables for the specific object they are called on, inputs, and class variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, objects are accessed somewhat like variables with complex internal structure, and in many languages are effectively pointers, serving as actual references to a single instance of said object in memory within a heap or stack. They provide a layer of abstraction which can be used to separate internal from external code. External code can use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters, read an instance variable, or write to an instance variable. Objects are created by calling a special type of method in the class known as a constructor. A program may create many instances of the same class as it runs, which operate independently. This is an easy way for the same procedures to be used on different sets of data."

    "### Creating Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything in it is an object, with its attributes and methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Class is like an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects. To create a class, use the keyword `class`. Class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the `pass` statement to avoid getting an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class. It does not have to be named `self`, you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class. It is a best practice to stick with `self` though.\n",
    "\n",
    "All classes have a function called `__init__()`, which is always executed when the class is being initiated.\n",
    "Use the `__init__()` function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created. The` __init__()` function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__str__()` function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string. If the `__str__()` function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned:\n",
