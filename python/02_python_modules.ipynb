    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming terminology, function is a separate, complete and reusable software component. Long and complex logic in a program is broken into smaller, independent and reusable blocks of instructions usually called a module, a subroutine or function. It is designed to perform a specific task that is a part of entire process. This approach towards software development is called modular programming. Such a program has a main routine through which smaller independent modules (functions) are called upon. When called, a function performs a specified task and returns the control back to the calling routine, optionally along with result of its process. Python interpreter has a number of built-in functions. They are always available for use in every interpreter session. For a full list of built-in python function check [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_functions.asp).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to built-in functions, a large number of pre-defined functions are also available as a part of libraries bundled with Python distributions. However they are not available for use automatically. These functions are defined in modules. A module is a file containing definition of functions, classes, variables, constants or any other Python object. Standard distribution of Python contains a large number of modules, generally known as built-in modules. Each built-in module contains resources for certain specific functionalities. Most of the times, built-in modules are written in C and integrated with Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of built-in modules there are also external modules. External modules in Python, are modules developed by other developers and organized into a proper library for us to use. These packages are important since they equip us with extra functionality."

    "## Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "A module can be considered to be the same as a code library. In other words, a file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application. To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension `.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example a module could be a file called `module_name.py` containing a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def function_name():\n",
    "  print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can be loaded by using the `import` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import module_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More often than not, is very useful to create an alias when you import a module, by using the `as` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import module_name as mn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use a function from a module, we use the following syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "module_name.function_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if an alias is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mn.function_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can contain functions, as already described, but also variables of all types (arrays, dictionaries, objects etc). To access the variables we use the same syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "module_name.variable_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if an alias is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mn.variable_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases we want to import only specific parts from a module and not the whole module. We do that by using the `from` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from module_name import function_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can use the function `function_name` directly as we would use it if it was defined by us (i.e without the need write `module_name.function_name`)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we already mentioned in the introduction there are two different kind of modules: built-in and extenral.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Built-In Modules**: Built-in modules are written in C and integrated with the Python shell. Each built-in module contains resources for certain system-specific functionalities such as OS management, disk IO, etc. The standard library also contains many Python scripts (with the . py extension) containing useful utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **External Modules**: External modules are important since they allow developers to break down large programs into small manageable files. Furthermore, modules also allow developers to reuse code. Once a Python file has been imported as a module into another file it gives us access to its classes and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several built-in modules in Python, which you can import whenever you like. Once a module is imported there is a built-in function to list all the function names (or variable names) withing the module called `dir()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "dir(module_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "External modules need to be installed before imported. This can be achieved through `pip`."
