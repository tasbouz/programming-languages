# Programming Languages
Notes I kept while learning various programming languages.

## - Go
You will need to install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.11 or later).
I run the code using [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/).

## - JavaScript
Open the html files with a browser to run them.

## - Python
You will need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.4 or later), and then jupyter notebooks.

## - R
You will need to install [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
